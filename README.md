# Zoom Bot
A bot that automatically joins Zoom meetings in your browser

### Installation

pip install selenium
pip install keyboard

Also need to install chromedriver, look online for the download then replace the path in the main.py to where it is on your computer

### How to use

Run the bot with:

sudo python main.py

1. Enter the Zoom Meeting ID and Passcode.

2. Specify the number of bots you want to join the meeting. Note: More bots require more RAM, so use caution.

3. Enter a name for the bot(s). Leave this blank to randomize the name. If you’re running multiple bots and specify a name, all bots will use the same name.

4. Hit Enter to start the bot(s). Please allow a few moments for them to join the meeting.

5. To safely exit the program, press Alt + Ctrl + Shift + E. If this doesn’t work, you may press Ctrl + C or close the program manually, but all the bots will disappear
